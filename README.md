## Description
* Every year there are lakhs of students who seek admission into various colleges around the country. Often students and their parents have to travel to multiple colleges physically to view the entire flora and fauna, view the infrastructure and gather information about various courses and facilities provided by college.
* Some people travel from one end of country to another which is time taking and is not easy to do instantly give the fact that students have very less time for completing the admission procedure. 
* Hence with the modern technology rapidly growing, sitting at home we can take a virtual tour of some famous places of the world. Addressing this problem will enable the parents and students to get a full virtual tour of the colleges and get the information regarding courses and facilities provided instantly. This will save the time and expenses of travelling also and will enable in better decision making for the parents/guardians while choosing colleges, courses and hostel facilities. 
* Geotagging of all educational institutions integrated with virtual tour on Bharat Map so that any students/parents can visit any part of the country on map and take virtual tour along with facilities/courses available across the country is a much needed solution to help the students and their parents/guardians take the decision sitting at home. It will enable the parents and students to get a full virtual tour of the colleges and get the information regarding courses and facilities provided instantly. This will save the time and with the current COVID crisis, this solution will be a boon for many students as risk of getting affected while travelling will be cut short completel
